"Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are lipid-enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses."
"Together with the host-derived membrane, a set of structural proteins provide an organizational scaffold that wraps and contains the positive-sense viral RNA. "
"Among them, the most critical is the spike, or S, protein, which is conserved to varying degrees across the Coronaviridae family and plays a key role in the virus’ initial attachment to and fusion with the host cell. "
"The S protein is a class I fusion protein, synthesized as a single 1273 amino acid polypeptide chain, which associates as a trimer. Each trimer can be divided into three main topological domains, namely the head, stalk, and cytoplasmic tail (CT), where we can identify the S1 and S2 subunits (Figure 1A)."
"One particularly interesting feature of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is its adoption of a novel furin cleavage site (S1/S2), likely cleaved by the TMPRSS protease, between S1 and S2; this site is believed to prime and activate the spike for infection. "
"A second proteolytic cleavage at S2ʹ releases the fusion peptide (FP), which penetrates and primes the host cell membrane for fusion."
"A number of recently published structural studies provide an atomic or a near-atomic understanding of the head portion of SARS-CoV-2 spike, which comprises multiple domains (Figure 1A)."
"The S1 subunit contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD), where the receptor binding motif (RBM) is responsible for the interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into the host. "
The S2 subunit has been aptly described as “a metastable spring-loaded fusion machine” because it plays a key role in integrating the viral and host cell membranes. 
"It contains the FP, the central helix (CH), and the connecting domain (CD)."
"Additional domains within the S2 subunit that are not resolved via cryo-EM or X-ray experiments include the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) and the transmembrane (TM) domains forming the stalk, and the CT."
"Another key structural feature of the S protein that eludes detailed experimental structural characterization is its extensive glycosylation, shown in Figure 1C."
"Protein glycosylation plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis,as demonstrated by the characteristically thick N-glycan coating of the viral fusion proteins."
"In the HIV-1 envelope spike (Env), for example, the protein-accessible surface area is almost entirely covered in N-glycans."
These are so densely packed that they account for more than half of the protein’s molecular weight.
The biological roles of the N-glycans expressed on the surface of viral envelope glycoproteins are very diverse and are all inextricably linked to their nature.
"Viral entry through membrane fusion is initiated by envelope glycoproteins through molecular recognition events involving cell surface receptors, which are often mediated by specific N-glycan epitopes."
"Moreover, a highly dense coating of non-immunogenic or weakly immunogenic complex carbohydrates on otherwise dangerously exposed viral proteins constitutes a perfect camouflage (or shield) to evade the immune system."
"To this end, the HIV-1 Env glycan shield, which is largely structured by oligomannose (Man5-9) N-glycans, has been shown to be quite effective in allowing the virus to thwart the immune system;it has also been found to be responsible for the virus’ interactions with DC-SIGN C-type lectins.Contrary to HIV-1 Env, the betacoronaviruses SARS and MERS S proteins are not shielded as effectively."
"Furthermore, both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 spikes present a rather different glycosylation pattern from that of HIV-1 Env, with a large presence of complex N-glycans relative to oligomannose type. "
"More specifically, the SARS-CoV-2 trimer has 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites per protomer,of which at least have been found to be occupied and 2 predicted O-glycosylation sites (see Figures 1C-1E)."
